Based on the Trips by Gender data, Male subscribers used the bikes more than the female subscribers. Additional study may help show why male subscribers use the service more than female subscribers. We can also ask "what, can we do to cater to our female subscribers in the future.

## Summary

Bikeshare services are very popular in busy areas of the city, where the area is densely packed with real estate, and parking is scares in the area. The male subscribers make up the larger users of the service. More questions and surveys should be sent out to our female subscribers to see what can be done to improve the number of female subscribers in using the services provided.

Other data points we could look at for further analyisi include:

When is the best time to perform needed bike repairs
Rush hour time windows, displaying the flow of traffic around the city/neighborhoods, peak hours
average trip duration by gender, birth year to analyize male, female, and un-gendered riders as they age
